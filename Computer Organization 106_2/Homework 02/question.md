Using SPIM, please write and test a MIPS assembly program that finds out the median of a sequence of integers.  
The sequence of integers should be provided by user through keyboard.  
The end of the sequence is indicated by a zero. The sorted sequence should be printed on screen.  
The algorithm is arbitrary but should be implemented by calling a subroutine.  
Please follow the general guideline for programming homeworks and submit your source code file through NDHUeLearning.  
Please write your report as comments in the beginning of your code file and use your student id as the name of the code file.
